### Direct-message threads

Source: `data/directmessages/DirectMessageRepository.kt`,
`data/mastodon/MastodonDirectMessageService.kt`,
`data/misskey/MisskeyDirectMessageService.kt`, and the direct-message tests.

- A conversation thread loads from a known post anchor in the stored conversation. The client
  does not guess a conversation identity from a post value.
- A conversation keeps an explicit identity. A server-issued identity may receive a server
  mark-read. A provisional local conversation clears unread state on this device and sends no
  server request until the server confirms the conversation.
- The Mastodon adapter loads the anchor through supported status endpoints. It never calls an
  undocumented individual conversation endpoint.
- Direct messages are federated private posts. They are not encrypted messaging.
