# Task State: Plan 03 Protocol And Notification Persistence

**Plan:** `docs/decomposition_3/03.md`.

**Companion plan:** `docs/decomposition_3/04.md`.

**Specification:** `docs/decomposition_3/progressreport.md` section 4.

**Acceptance matrix:** `docs/agents/decomposition-01-02-acceptance-matrix.md` (Plan 01/02 record).

**Started:** 2026-09-15.

**This task is larger than one safe implementation slice.**

## Objective

Rebase Plan 03 against the completed Plan 01/02 and gate boundaries. Then implement its
behavior chunks. Make Mastodon capability decisions accurate. Reject foreign Misskey
entity identities before authenticated requests. Complete notification codec ownership
without changing installed data.

## Invariants

- Keep protocol JSON behind adapters.
- Notification persistence JSON converts domain values, not server payloads.
- Keep connection origins separate from remote public URLs.
- Keep account identity, runtime generation, and durable session revision distinct.
- Do not log tokens, push endpoints, full responses, private bodies, or corrupt blobs.
- Preserve cancellation explicitly. Do not map every failure to unsupported or corrupt.
- Preserve version 2, keys, enum strings, defaults, omission behavior, and catch boundaries.
- Do not change a stored format without a migration in the same slice.
- Use Beeline in user-facing text. Keep the codename out of user-facing content.
- Commit after every verified slice. A slice commit is required as soon as its tests are green.
  Do not commit a slice whose tests are not green. Do not leave a green slice uncommitted.

## Accepted Decisions

- The progress report is the Plan 03 rebase authority.
- Chunks 03-A through 03-C are independent of codec work.
- Chunks 03-F and 03-G need one shared storage failure contract.
- The maintainer approved the 03-F reset behavior and the 03-I visibility migration on
  2026-09-15. The accepted policy is development-only discard: do not migrate old notification
  data. Discard unreadable or incompatible local state and require reauthentication when needed.
- Chunks 03-I (visibility migration) and 03-F reset behavior are approved to code.
- No emulator is reachable. Instrumented and live-server checks stay blocked verification.

## Rebase Findings (R-01)

Source verified against `HEAD`. Plan 03's baseline `c78e2cf` predates C-01..C-15 and P-01..P-07.

- 03-A: closed by 03-A1 and 03-A2. The sentinel mutation probe is removed. The recognized
  instance advertisement is the only positive instance-metadata evidence. NodeInfo discovery
  is the supplemental fallback with validated same-origin URLs, a credential-free request,
  disabled redirects, bounded reads, and a one-document fetch.
- 03-B: closed by 03-B1 and 03-B2. The bare-404 downgrade and the non-reactive `EmojiHost`
  read are closed. Refreshed capabilities publish under a session-revision guard, and a
  failed metadata probe backs off for 30 seconds.
- 03-C: still required, reduced scope. `MisskeySource.post` (`:102`) and `delete` (`:549`)
  omit `validatePostId`. Repost undo (`:442`) and quote creation (`:350`) already validate.
- 03-D: closed by 03-D1, 03-D2, and 03-D3. The complete state envelope, file-store
  contract, Room fixed-JSON read, activity variants, navigation, read states, delivery
  records, posts and accounts, interaction counts, unread state, settings, push, checkpoints,
  malformed structure, and known omissions are frozen.
- 03-E: closed. `NotificationJsonCodec.kt` owns the state boundary and every recursive
  conversion helper. `NotificationRepository.kt` keeps no `JSONObject` or `JSONArray`
  conversion helper. `Notification.matches`, `AccountId.stableFileName`, and
  `stableNotificationId` stay in the repository for 03-J.
- 03-H: still required. `LegacyNotificationFileImporter` writes the marker before returning
  state and before Room saves (`LegacyNotificationFileImporter.kt:22-25`).
- 03-J: `AccountId.stableFileName()` still lives in the domain or data path. Rebase its
  target during 03-J.

## Rebase Corrections Applied

- Authority map: `data/SourceFactory.kt` does not exist at that path. Source construction uses
  `SocialSourceFactory`. Corrected in the plan.
- Capability publication owner: use the `ConnectedSessionContext` source from C-01.
- Notification caller-query validation already exists from Plan 02. Preserve it during codec work.
- Verification commands gained `--no-daemon --console=plain`.
- Added `MastodonReactionExtensionMapper` and the per-protocol cursor codecs to the authority map.
- `Post.contentVisibility` omission is confirmed and approved for 03-I. The approved policy
  discards old notification data instead of migrating it forward.

## Completed Slices

| Slice | Scope | Exit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | Rebase `docs/decomposition_3/03.md` against the completed boundaries. | Every rebase requirement is applied. Stale paths and commands are corrected. | implemented, source verified. |
| 03-C | Close Misskey entity boundaries. Validate `post`, `delete`, and quote identities before network access. | Invalid or foreign identities reach no network request. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-A1 | Remove the sentinel reaction probe. Treat the recognized advertisement as the evidence. Bound the instance read and add a v1 fallback on v2 absence. | No capability request contains a sentinel status. Missing advertisement never proves support. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-B1 | Preserve runtime capability evidence. Remove the bare-404 downgrade, publish capabilities reactively, reuse the metadata owner at login, and invalidate sentinel-era snapshots. | A resource failure keeps advertised support. Reaction controls read an observable capability value. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-B2 | Publish refreshed capabilities under a session-revision guard and bound refresh retries. | A stale source cannot overwrite a replaced session. A failed probe does not re-probe on every request. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-D1 | Freeze the notification state-envelope codec. Add `NotificationJsonCodecTest` and literal fixtures for the complete and legacy minimal states. Add file-store fixed-JSON tests. | The state envelope round-trips. Legacy defaults, legacy target-only navigation, and the legacy reaction `imageUrl` are characterized. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-A2 | Add NodeInfo discovery when instance metadata omits the reaction advertisement. Validate discovery URLs, keep the request credential-free, disable redirects, bound reads, and fetch one document. | A server that advertises reactions only in NodeInfo gets React. A foreign, credentialed, or fragmented URL triggers no request. All discovery failures stay Unknown. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-D2 | Freeze the activity, navigation, read-state, and delivery fixtures. Add the Room fixed-JSON read test. | Every activity discriminant, navigation target, read state, and delivery state is characterized. Room decodes JSON inserted directly. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-D3 | Freeze the remaining fixtures: posts and accounts, interaction counts, unread state, settings, push, checkpoints, malformed structure, and known omissions. | Every remaining 03-D family has a fixed decoder contract, and the encoder-stable families round-trip. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-E | Move every recursive encode and decode helper from `NotificationRepository` into `NotificationJsonCodec` and make them private. | No conversion helper remains in the repository. The moved text stays identical apart from ownership and visibility. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-F1 | Add a typed store read result that separates absent, readable, corrupt, and unavailable. | Every store read returns one of the four variants. The repository behavior stays unchanged. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-F2 | Validate the receiving-account ownership of decoded state. | A foreign notification, group, delivery, checkpoint, push, or dismissal origin is Corrupt. Remote actors and public URLs stay valid. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-F3 | Add the recoverable storage health, the write, delivery, and push block, the unavailable settings state, and the retry path. | A blocked account keeps its original bytes and blocks every mutation. A retry recovers only after a readable load. Healthy accounts continue normally. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-F4 | Refuse newer stored formats, add the approved account-local reset, and record Room schema history. | A newer-format payload stays untouched and blocks writes. Reset revokes the old generation, clears only notification-local state, and prevents legacy reimport. The exported schema is committed and guarded by a test. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-G | Make notification write failures explicit through durable acceptance. | Every mutation publishes only after the store accepts the write while the writer is still current. A failed write marks the account Unavailable, publishes nothing, and returns failure. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-H | Make legacy import restart-safe. | The Room row wins over the legacy file. The marker is written only after a successful Room save. Transient failures stay unmarked for retry. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-I | Persist post visibility and withhold hidden bodies. | Every stored post carries `contentVisibility`, including nested quotes. Missing or unknown values decode Hidden. Android previews and row bodies stay hidden for non-visible posts. | implemented, test verified. |
| 03-J | Place identity helpers with their owners. | `AccountId.stableFileName` lives in `NotificationStore.kt`. `stableNotificationId` lives in `NotificationPageMerge.kt`. Both algorithms are unchanged. | implemented, test verified. |

R-01 verification: source verified for every named authority at `b715430`. No test ran. The
rebase changed documentation only.

03-C verification: `MisskeyIntegrationTest` and `CrossCuttingTest` pass. Added
`misskeyPostAndDeleteRejectForeignOriginsBeforeNetwork`,
`misskeyPostAndDeleteRejectBlankValuesBeforeNetwork`, and
`misskeyCreateRejectsForeignAndBlankQuoteBeforeNetwork`. `post` and `delete` now call
`validatePostId`. Quote creation uses the same validator. Repost undo already validated.

03-A1 verification: `MastodonCapabilityProbeTest` and `MastodonIntegrationTest` pass. Removed
`EmojiMutationProbeOutcome`, `probeEmojiReactionMutation`, and the status-1 sentinel request.
`parseCapabilities` now takes only the instance. A recognized advertisement yields listing and
mutation support with independent selection. Missing or malformed advertisement yields Unknown
and no React action. `fetchInstanceMetadata` prefers `v2/instance`, falls back to `v1/instance`
only on 404, bounds the read to 512 KiB, and propagates every other failure.

03-B1 verification: `MastodonIntegrationTest`, `MastodonCapabilityProbeTest`,
`MisskeyIntegrationTest`, `CrossCuttingTest`, and `SignInScreenTest` pass. `test assembleRelease`
and `:app:lintDebug` pass. `MastodonSource.react` and `removeReaction` no longer contain a
downgrade path. `SocialSource.observeCapabilities()` is added with a snapshot default.
`MisskeySource` and `MastodonSource` return their capability state flow. `EmojiHost` collects
that flow. `CURRENT_CAPABILITY_SCHEMA_VERSION` is `5`. `MastodonAuth` reuses
`MastodonCapabilityProbe.fetchInstanceMetadata`. New tests
`failedReactionMutationKeepsExtensionSupport`, `failedAddAndRemoveKeepSupportForLaterPosts`, and
`refreshedCapabilitiesPublishReactionSupportThroughTheFlow`.

03-B2 verification: `MastodonIntegrationTest`, `CrossCuttingTest`, `MisskeyIntegrationTest`, and
`ConnectedSessionContextTest` pass. `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug` pass.
`SessionStore.updateCapabilities` and `AccountFileStore.updateCapabilities` take an optional
`expectedRevision` and skip the write when the stored session revision differs.
`SocialSourceFactory` passes `session.sessionRevision` for both protocols. `MastodonSource`
publishes a successful refresh through `onCapabilitiesUpdated` and backs off 30 seconds after a
failed probe. New tests `refreshedCapabilitiesReachTheCapabilityCallback`,
`metadataFailureBoundsCapabilityRetries`, and `capabilityUpdateRequiresTheCurrentSessionRevision`.

03-D1 verification: `NotificationJsonCodecTest` passes with ten tests. The fixtures are
`app/src/test/resources/notifications/complete_current_state.json` and
`legacy_minimal_state.json`. Provenance is `app/src/test/resources/notifications/PROVENANCE.md`.
The decoder assertions use independent expected domain values. The encoder contract compares
`encode(decode(fixture))` to the literal fixture by JSON structure, not by serialized string.
The file-store tests write the fixed JSON to disk and read it through `FileNotificationStore`,
and write a state and compare the stored file to the fixture. `test assembleRelease` and
`:app:lintDebug` pass.

03-A2 verification: `MastodonNodeInfoDiscoveryTest` passes with eleven tests. `MastodonCapabilityProbeTest`,
`MastodonIntegrationTest`, and `MisskeyIntegrationTest` pass. `test assembleRelease` and
`:app:lintDebug` pass. `probeCapabilities` fetches `/.well-known/nodeinfo` and one same-origin
NodeInfo document only when instance metadata has no advertisement. NodeInfo 2.1 is preferred.
Foreign, cross-scheme, credentialed, and fragmented URLs cause no document request. Discovery
failures and the 256 KiB read bound keep reactions Unknown without throwing. `MastodonAuth` now
uses `probeCapabilities`, so login applies the same evidence rules. `MisskeyApi.getUrl` uses
`ProductIdentity.userAgent` instead of the stale `Palustris/0.1` value.

03-D2 verification: `NotificationJsonCodecTest` passes with twenty tests including the activity,
navigation, read-state, and delivery variants. `NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest` passes with two
tests. The Room read test inserts the fixed JSON directly into the `notification_state` row, then
reads it through `RoomNotificationStore`. The Room write test round-trips the decoded state.
`decode` collapses duplicate delivery IDs to the last record, and a malformed server destination
falls back to the target or drops. `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug` pass.

03-D3 verification: `NotificationJsonCodecTest` passes with thirty-nine tests and
`NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest` passes with three tests. New fixtures: `posts_and_accounts.json`,
`interaction_counts.json`, `unread_states.json`, `settings_states.json`, `push_states.json`,
`checkpoints.json`, `checkpoint_fallback.json`, `malformed_root_shape.json`, `malformed_entries.json`,
`malformed_checkpoint.json`, `malformed_push.json`, `malformed_broken.json`, and
`known_omissions.json`. `posts_and_accounts` and `checkpoints` are encoder-stable. The manifest
fixtures hold one state per case because the codec stores one unread, settings, or push value per
state. Confirmed decoder boundaries: malformed item, dismissal, and delivery entries drop
individually; a malformed singular checkpoint or push registration fails the complete decode; the
file store returns no state for broken JSON while the Room store throws. Post visibility and group
actor continuation stay unpersisted. `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug` pass.

03-E verification: `NotificationJsonCodecTest` passes with forty tests and
`NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest` passes with four tests. The recursive helpers moved into
`NotificationJsonCodec.kt` and became private. `encode` and `decode` stay internal for both
stores. `Notification.matches`, `AccountId.stableFileName`, and `stableNotificationId` stay in
`NotificationRepository.kt`. A `Compare-Object` check confirms the moved text is identical to
the previous repository text apart from `internal` to `private`. Added file-store and Room
coverage for the nested unknown server destination. `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`
pass. All frozen fixture expectations are unchanged.

03-F1 verification: `NotificationStoreRead` has the variants Absent, Readable, Corrupt, and
Unavailable. `NotificationStore.read` returns it. `FileNotificationStore` classifies malformed
JSON and invalid values as Corrupt and an IO failure as Unavailable. `RoomNotificationStore`
classifies a malformed row as Corrupt and a DAO or save failure as Unavailable. A corrupt read
never carries stored bytes. `NotificationRepository` keeps the current behavior and collapses
the variants to an empty state until 03-F3. `NotificationJsonCodecTest` (43 tests) and
`NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest` (4 tests) pass, with `NotificationRepositoryTest`,
`NotificationSettingsTest`, `PushRegistrationRepositoryTest`, and `NotificationSynchronizerTest`,
then `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`. `MediaViewerScreenTest` timed out once under
concurrent build load and passed on rerun.

03-F2 verification: `NotificationRepositoryState.hasReceivingAccount` checks notifications,
groups, deliveries, singular and keyed checkpoints, push registration, and dismissal origins.
It compares the connection origin and the local ID. Remote actors, post authors, and public
URLs do not participate. The file and Room stores return Corrupt for a foreign state and keep
the original bytes. `complete_current_state.json` is now a single-account state because the
store is account-scoped. `NotificationStateOwnershipTest` (8 tests), `NotificationJsonCodecTest`,
and `NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest` pass, with the related notification suites, then
`test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`.

03-F3 verification: `NotificationStorageHealth` has the variants `Healthy`, `Recoverable`, and
`Unavailable`, and it stays outside the stored version-2 payload. `NotificationRepository`
publishes it through `observeStorageHealth` and recovers through `retry`. Page ingestion, the
baseline, local mutations, delivery claims and finishing, settings writes, and push registration
writes all require healthy storage. `pendingDeliveries` and `pushRegistration` return nothing for
a blocked account. `retry` returns immediately for a healthy account, replaces the in-memory state
only after a readable load, and leaves the original bytes untouched on another failure.
`NotificationsViewModel` surfaces `storageUnavailable` and uses the existing refresh action as the
retry path. `NotificationSettingsViewModel` surfaces `storageUnavailable`, blocks a save, and
exposes `retryStorage` through the contract and both settings hosts. `strings.xml` adds
`notifications_storage_unavailable`. `NotificationStorageRecoveryTest` (5 tests) passes, with the
focused notification suites, then `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`. `assembleRelease`
and `:app:lintDebug` pass. `MediaViewerScreenTest` failed once under concurrent build load and
passed on rerun, matching the 03-F1 note.

03-F4 verification: `NotificationStoreRead` adds the `Unsupported` variant and
`NotificationStorageHealth` adds the `Unsupported` variant. `CURRENT_NOTIFICATION_STATE_VERSION` is
`2`, and `JSONObject.isFutureNotificationStateVersion` refuses a version above the current one.
Both stores keep the original bytes for a future version. `NotificationRepository.reset` advances the
account generation, writes an empty readable state, clears the in-memory state, and sets health
`Healthy`. The settings surface adds a confirmed reset action behind `notifications_storage_reset`.
`NotificationDatabase` exports its schema to `app/schemas`. `NotificationJsonCodecTest`,
`NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest`, `NotificationStorageRecoveryTest`,
`NotificationDatabaseSchemaTest`, and `NotificationSettingsStorageResetTest` pass with the related
notification suites, then `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`. The `1` to `2` Room migration
stays defensive because no version-1 schema was ever released.

03-G verification: `NotificationRepository.commitWrite` computes each transition from committed
state, writes it on the injected IO dispatcher, and publishes it only while the token generation
is still current. A failed write marks the account `Unavailable`, publishes nothing, and returns
failure. Transitions serialize on a per-account lock. `claimDelivery` returns null on failure so
the worker never presents it. `dismissFromInbox` and `markAndroidDismissed` stay retryable and
never acknowledge the server. `acknowledge`, `updateSettings`, `updatePushRegistration`, and
`clearPushRegistration` return failure without repeating remote work. `remove` revokes memory
first and treats row deletion as best effort. `NotificationsViewModelTest` injects the test
dispatcher into the repository. `NotificationWriteFailureTest` (8 tests) passes with the focused
notification suites, then `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`.

03-H verification: `LegacyNotificationFileImporter` separates reading from marking. `RoomNotificationStore.read`
checks the Room row first, then the marker, then the legacy file. A readable legacy state is saved
to Room before the marker is written. A failed save, a corrupt file, a future format, or a transient
failure stays unmarked. A missing marker never reimports over a saved Room row. `delete` removes
the legacy file and marks the account so a removed account cannot resurrect old state. Cancellation
propagates without marking health. `NotificationLegacyImportTest` (11 tests) passes with the focused
notification suites, then `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`. `:app:assembleDebugAndroidTest`
still fails in the pre-existing `Api29StartupInstrumentedTest` (missing constructor arguments);
`RoomNotificationStoreInstrumentedTest` itself compiles after the typed-read repair.

03-I verification: `encodePost` always writes `contentVisibility`, including nested quotes.
`decodePost` maps a missing or unknown value to `Hidden`, so old blobs withhold their cached
bodies until an authenticated refresh replaces them. The format stays at version 2: the field
is additive, and old fixtures remain readable. `NotificationDeliveryPlanner` prepares an Android
preview only for `Visible` public posts. `NotificationRow` never renders the body of a `Hidden`
post. New fixture `post_visibility.json` covers visible, hidden, filtered, and nested-hidden
posts through the codec, the file store, and Room restart. `posts_and_accounts.json` keeps its
bytes and now characterizes legacy decode to Hidden. `NotificationJsonCodecTest`,
`NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest`, `NotificationDeliveryPlannerTest`, and
`NotificationsScreenTest` pass with the focused notification suites, then `test assembleRelease`
and `:app:lintDebug`.

03-J verification: the move changes ownership and imports only. `AccountId.stableFileName`
keeps its SHA-256 input and exact output in `NotificationStore.kt`. `stableNotificationId`
keeps its hash input and exact output in `NotificationPageMerge.kt`. `Notification.matches`
stays in `NotificationRepository.kt`. All callers stay in the same package, so no caller
changes. `NotificationJsonCodecTest`, `NotificationRoomStoreFixtureTest`,
`AndroidNotificationIdsTest`, `NotificationStateOwnershipTest`, `NotificationRepositoryTest`,
`NotificationStorageRecoveryTest`, `NotificationWriteFailureTest`, `NotificationLegacyImportTest`,
`NotificationDeliveryPlannerTest`, the settings and push suites, and `NotificationDatabaseSchemaTest`
pass, then `test assembleRelease` and `:app:lintDebug`.

## Current Slice

03-J is complete. Every Plan 03 chunk is implemented and test verified.

## Required Verification

Use focused tests first. Then run the full gate.

```powershell
$env:GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*MastodonCapabilityProbeTest" --tests "*MastodonIntegrationTest" --tests "*MisskeyIntegrationTest" --tests "*CrossCuttingTest"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain test assembleRelease
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:lintDebug
```

Close standard input. Set an explicit timeout for each Gradle call.

## Unresolved Blockers

- No emulator or device is reachable. Connected instrumentation stays unverified.
- Live-server behavior stays unverified.
- Signed-release behavior stays unverified.
- The Android 15 system-bar failure stays in `logs/BUGS.txt`.
- No approval blocker remains for 03-F or 03-I. Their reset and visibility policy is approved.
- Residual 03-G ordering risk: the final generation check keeps revoked writes out of memory,
  but a disk write that lands after revocation and before row deletion can leave stale bytes.
  Full closure needs removal and reset serialized on the same per-account write boundary.
