# Task State: Decomposition 01 And 02 Completion

**Plans:** `docs/decomposition_3/01.md`, `docs/decomposition_3/02.md`.

**Specification:** `docs/decomposition_3/progressreport.md` (sections 3 and 5).

**Acceptance matrix:** `docs/agents/decomposition-01-02-acceptance-matrix.md`.

**Started:** 2026-09-14.

**This task is larger than one safe implementation slice.**

## Objective

Meet the Plan 01 and Plan 02 exit conditions. Close the ten gaps in `progressreport.md`
section 1. Keep the completed extractions and repairs. Do not recreate the old argument lists.

## Invariants

- Keep runtime generation, durable session revision, and registry generation separate.
- Keep protocol behavior in adapters.
- Keep shared domain models protocol-neutral.
- Keep account secrets, tokens, and sources out of presentation contracts.
- Capture ownership before launch. Check authority after every suspension.
- Reserve an operation slot synchronously. Release only the owning operation's slot.
- Merge from current accepted state, not a captured whole-screen snapshot.
- Keep cursors opaque. Preserve adapter order. Do not infer chronology from opaque IDs.
- Keep Home and Photo Grid state independent.
- Keep drafts account-scoped and encrypted.
- Do not change a stored format without a migration in the same slice.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Use Beeline in user-facing text. Keep the codename out of user-facing content.
- The shell consumes one accepted connected context. It never joins separate session flows.
- A connected context carries no token to presentation. The source stays internal to hosts.

## Accepted Decisions

- The progress report is the completion specification.
- The acceptance matrix is the single status record for the exit conditions.
- One completion slice owns one behavior.
- Documentation changes belong in the same slice as the behavior that changes.
- Plans 03 and 04 stay assigned to later work. They require a rebase before implementation.
- A file extraction alone does not close a behavioral exit condition.
- `NotificationSyncController.register` returns the sync token that owns the registered source.
  Registration is synchronous. A delayed registration is not part of the current boundary.

## Completed Slices

| Slice | Report step | Scope | Exit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-01 | Step 2 | Make connected identity coherent. Resolve one accepted context. Remove the `sourceFactory.create` fallback. | Every source-backed feature receives values from one accepted connected lifetime. | implemented, test verified. Commit `6b8752b`. |
| C-02 | Step 3 | Repair ViewModel lifetime and route re-entry. Add an explicit connected-entry store and lifecycle owner. | Retired owners cannot publish. Re-entered features never receive stopped owners. | implemented, test verified. Commit `ffc9c3f`. |
| C-03 | Step 4 | Complete DM durable write authority. Route `markRead` through `commitIfCurrent`. Keep network outside locks. | A retired session cannot mutate current DM storage. Removed rows stay deleted. | implemented, test verified. Commit `bfbd7ed`. |
| C-04 | Step 5 | Give DM recovery text a feature owner. Add an editor revision. Clear only on accepted success. | A send failure cannot erase recoverable text. | implemented, test verified. Commit `cb6d024`. |
| C-05 | Step 6 | Establish a composer editor owner. Move editor fields out of `PalustrisApp`. | `PalustrisApp` requests composer transitions. It does not implement editor state. | implemented, test verified. Commit `bd2d1b6`. |
| C-06a | Step 7, part 1 | Make publish completion version-aware. Reserve the submission before the async save. Reject obsolete save callbacks. Clear and delete only the submitted version. | No late save clears newer text or starts an obsolete publish. | implemented, test verified. Commit `84006c1`. |
| C-06b | Step 7, part 2 | Move the draft storage owner into the data layer. Bind draft operations to the account. Add load request identity. Report load and delete failures. | The presentation contract carries no storage. Draft failures are reported. | implemented, test verified. Commit `c1288da`. |
| C-06c | Step 7, part 3 | Coordinate account removal with pending draft writes. | A remove cannot leave recreated draft data. | implemented, test verified. Commit `4454bae`. |
| C-07 | Step 8 | Stabilize post-action ownership and projection. Use typed families. Retire the coordinator with its entry. | Every surface receives the accepted action result once. Retired popups have no authority. | implemented, test verified. Commit `0027b60`. |
| C-08 | Step 9 | Complete Home paging demand. Include filter identity and the request epoch. Count accepted pages. | Home reaches older visible content without unbounded automatic requests. | implemented, test verified. Commit `a011a06`. |
| C-09 | Step 10 | Finish notification request and launch ownership. Add request identity. Return explicit launch acceptance. | Rejected pages change no state. An undelivered launch is not acknowledged. | implemented, test verified. Commit `c6ab9b1`. |
| C-10 | Step 11 | Complete settings validity and recovery. Bind commands to lifecycle-valid targets. Add recovery. | A settings command cannot change another account or restore deleted account state. | implemented, test verified. Commit `731b74b`. |
| C-11 | Step 12 | Repair locale event direction. Separate startup reconciliation from later commands. | The latest accepted user choice controls resources and survives restart. | implemented, test verified. Commit `43f8aa0`. |

C-01 changed `AccountManager`, `NotificationSyncController`, `ConnectedApp`,
`ConnectedSessionHost`, `MainActivity`, `SessionViewModelTest`, and added
`ui/session/ConnectedSessionContext.kt` and `ConnectedSessionContextTest.kt`.

C-02 added `ui/session/ConnectedEntryStore.kt` and `ConnectedEntryStoreTest.kt`. It changed
`ConnectedApp`, `ConnectedSessionHost`, the feature hosts, `SettingsOverlayHost`, and
`NotificationSettingsViewModel`.

C-03 changed `DirectMessageWriteAuthority`, `DirectMessageRepository`, `DirectMessageViewModel`,
`DirectMessagesHost`, `ConnectedSessionContext`, `ConnectedSessionHost`, and `AccountManager`. It
changed `DirectMessageRepositoryTest`, `DirectMessageSourceTest`, and `DirectMessageViewModelTest`.
`DirectMessageWriteAuthority` now activates, revokes, deletes, and commits under one per-account
lock. The account lifecycle issues the writer generation. A repository captures that generation. It
does not issue one. `markRead` routes its local write through `commitIfCurrent`. Network requests
stay outside every lock.

C-04 moved the direct-message composer text into `DirectMessageViewModel`. The state now carries
`editorText` and `editorRevision`. `DirectMessageUiState` owns them. Each editor change and each
selection change advances the revision. A selection change resets the text. `DirectMessagesContract`
adds `updateEditor(text)` and changes `send(text)` to `send()`. `DirectMessageConversationScreen` is
stateless. It reads `state.editorText` and calls `onEditorTextChange`. The Send button no longer
clears the text. A send captures the text and revision. It clears the editor only after accepted
success when the revision is unchanged. A failed send keeps the text.

C-05 added `ui/composer/ComposerEditorState.kt`, `ui/composer/ComposerOwner.kt`, and
`ui/composer/ComposerHost.kt`. The owner holds text, warning, audience, draft identity, the dirty
snapshot, the drafts list, reply and quote restoration, draft value construction, save, delete, and
publish. It publishes `ComposerNavigation` requests. The shell applies a request by placing the
composer overlay. `PalustrisApp` no longer holds editor fields. It renders the editor from the owner
and keeps overlay placement and back precedence. The editor state uses a saveable snapshot. A session
replacement clears restored reply and quote targets.

C-06a gave `ComposerOwner` an editor revision and a reserved submission. Each editor mutation
advances the revision. `publish` captures the request, account, draft identity, revision, and
session revision, then reserves the submission before the asynchronous draft save starts. A second
publish is rejected while a submission is reserved. An obsolete save callback cannot publish. A
successful publish clears and deletes only the submitted version. The publish control disables while
a submission is in flight.

C-06b added `data/auth/DraftActions.kt`. The draft storage owner left `ui/shell/DraftsContract.kt`.
The presentation contract carries no storage type. `DraftActions.create` holds the legacy preferences
lookup in the data layer. `DraftActions` binds to one account. `ui/composer/DraftsContractAdapter.kt`
adapts it to the presentation contract. `ComposerOwner.refreshDrafts` uses a load epoch so a stale
load result cannot replace a newer one. Load and delete failures report an explicit message.

C-06c added `data/auth/DraftWriteAuthority.kt`. The authority mirrors `DirectMessageWriteAuthority`
with one lock per account, monotonic generations, `activate`, `invalidate`, `invalidateAndDelete`,
and `commitIfCurrent`. `AccountManager.connect` activates the draft generation before it publishes
the context. `updateAccount` carries the generation into the rebuilt context. `removeAccount`
revokes writers and deletes rows in one serialized boundary. `DraftActions` routes save and delete
through `commitIfCurrent`. A revoked writer writes nothing and reports no success. `ConnectedSessionHost`
builds the draft owner from `connectedContext.draftGeneration` and the injected authority.

C-07 added `PostActionFamily` and `OperationToken` to `PostInteractionExecutionAuthority`. Family
slots are typed. Acquisition returns the owning token or null when busy. Only that token releases
the slot. `PostInteractionMutationOwner`, `ProfileViewModel`, and `PostThreadViewModel` use the
token API. `PostProjectionCoordinator` retires with its connected entry, rejects forwards and
registrations after retirement, and rejects repeated deliveries of one accepted publication by its
created-post identity. `PostActionOwner` retires with its connected entry and rejects later opens,
mutations, and reports. `ConnectedSessionHost` builds the popup owner from the stable connected
identity, reads the profile refresh callback without recreating the owner, and registers both
retirements with the entry store. The narrow popup interface extraction stays deferred to C-12.

C-08 published the feed request epoch through `FeedState` and `HomeFeedUiState`. `FeedViewModel`
advances the epoch on refresh and timeline replacement, including failed timeline changes. Paging
keeps the epoch. `HomePagingDemand` tracks filter identity and the epoch beside the row count, so
a filter or epoch change at the same count still resets the budget. `reset` advances a demand
generation so evaluation reruns even when rows are unchanged. `onPageAccepted` counts only
accepted pages. The demand blocks while sign-in is required.

C-09 gave `NotificationsViewModel` a request epoch. Refresh and paging capture the query identity
before launch, reserve their slots synchronously, and reject stale completions so rejected pages
change no state. Paging returns at the reserved slot instead of cancelling the page in flight. A
refresh supersedes paging display. `NotificationLaunchHost` always calls the latest route callback
and acknowledges a launch only when the receiving shell accepts its route. `ConnectedApp` accepts
only with an accepted connected context, so an undelivered launch stays pending. A missing account
routes to the recoverable unavailable state. A failed switch resolves through the accounts update,
which reruns the effect into the same unavailable state.

C-10 bound post commands to the validated account set the shell publishes. A command for a
removed account reports an explicit unavailable error at call time. A command queued before the
removal writes nothing and reports nothing. Failed commands are retained for explicit retry.
Dismissing the error hides the message but keeps the retry until the next command. Command errors
are typed, so the shell resolves the user-visible message from resources. Account settings models
wait for the restored account index instead of constructing eagerly. The settings error card
gains a retry action.

C-11 added `ui/localization/AppLocaleOwner.kt`. The owner applies first-upgrade precedence once
through `reconcilePlatformSelection`, then follows observed movement: a moved repository exports
the in-app choice to the platform, and a moved platform imports the external choice into the
repository, including an external clear to System default. A pending import repeats until the
repository applies it, and a stale platform read after an export re-asserts the repository.
`MainActivity` serializes each decision with its side effect under one mutex, prefers the
platform value for the base context on Android 13 and later, recreates only when an applied
import leaves a stale base context, and reports a failed import through repository state without
a recreation loop. The Language settings route already survives recreation through
`SettingsRouteSaver`.

C-12a added `ui/composer/ComposerOverlayHost.kt`. The shell chooses composer overlay
placement and keeps open, guarded close, and emoji-picker target requests. The feature owns
the sheet assembly: the save control, the editor bindings, publish with its confirmation
message, and tracking cleanup. The owner lifetime and the saveable editor state stay where
they are. Only sheet assembly moved. The dead `postPreferences` local left the shell with
it. A composer presentation change now touches `ui/composer/`, `ui/ComposerScreen.kt`, or
`ui/ComposerSheet.kt`. It needs no shell contract change and no fixture change:
`AppShellFixtures.app` constructs the unchanged `ComposerContract`.

C-12b added `ui/navigation/ShellBackPolicy.kt`. The back-precedence order left the shell body
for a pure decision: `topSurfaceForBack` maps one `ShellBackState` to the dismissed surface or
to null when back has no shell target. `PalustrisApp` keeps the state and the guarded dismissal
functions, and routes `dismissTopSurface` plus the back and edge-swipe conditions through the
policy. The order matches the replaced inline `when` exactly, including the wide-layout overlay
order and the media-viewer back ownership. The dead `AppBackHandler` and `BackNavigationState`
stay untouched for slice C-15.

C-12c added `ComposerFeatureFixtures.reply` beside the composer tests. The harness composes
the Home feed presenter with the composer feature owner and overlay host, without the full
shell. Reply and quote transitions resolve through the owner. `ReplyComposerTest` moved to
the harness with no assertion change and passed on the first run. `HomeFeedTest` and
`SignInScreenTest` still construct the full shell; their scroll-clearance, capability-gated,
and account-switching assertions need shell assembly, so they stay for slice C-12d4.

C-12d1 moved the private preview-only `AppPreview` out of `PalustrisApp.kt` into
`ui/PalustrisAppPreview.kt`. The preview still composes the full shell with the empty
contracts. No production behavior changed. `PalustrisApp.kt` now keeps navigation and
placement only.

C-12d2 added `ui/navigation/ShellNavigator.kt`. The holder owns destination, direction,
timeline, page, sheet, overlay key, search and notification panels with their shared
fields, navigation visibility, viewed profile, selected post, and notification route.
A `listSaver` persists the saved fields; transient selection stays out. The
`rememberShellNavigator` host clamps the timeline, follows the Home selection, reasserts
navigation visibility, applies the launch route, and clears account-scoped selection on
account change. `PalustrisApp` keeps its transition functions and session-bound guards;
they delegate to navigator properties. `ShellNavigatorTest` covers overlay mapping,
selection clear, timeline clamp and sync, account reset scope, launch routes, and a
`Saver` round trip. The full-shell suites pass unchanged.

C-12d3 moved the guarded transition functions into `ShellNavigator` behind event
callbacks: destination selection, profile opening, large-target selection, direct-message
opening, hashtag and account search openers, and single-post selection. The shell
supplies popup clearing, search execution, and conversation start at the host call.
Session-bound guards (`openMedia`, `openReactionBubble`, guarded composer and profile
closes) stay in `PalustrisApp`. `ShellNavigatorTest` gained transition coverage. The
full-shell suites pass unchanged.

C-12d4 added `HomeFeatureFixtures.feed` beside the feed tests. The harness composes
the Home feed presenter directly, without shell assembly, navigation, or popups. Row
rendering, filtering, counts, and truncation resolve through the presenter. `HomeFeedTest`
migrated its `show` helper to the harness; the compact scroll-clearance, full-post bubble,
and link-truncation bubble tests stay on the shell through `showInShell` because floating
assembly and the navigator-owned single-post detail live in shell placement. `SignInScreenTest`
migrated its content-warning, sensitive-media, and disabled-action tests to the harness;
the composer, account-switcher, action-ownership, and reaction-bubble tests stay on the
shell because the overlay, switcher, confirmation, and emoji popup hosts live there. The
dead bookmark recorder left with the migrated assertion. All 37 plus 13 tests pass.

Split a slice when it spans independent behavior. Keep one verification method for each slice.

C-15 is a behavior-neutral cleanup. It is not part of the Plan 01 or Plan 02 exit conditions. It
removes dead scaffolding that earlier extraction waves left behind. The symbol list and the
replacement for each symbol are in `docs/agents/app-shell-ownership.md`. Do not combine it with a
behavior change.

## Current Slice

None. The completion work is done. Plan 01 and Plan 02 exit conditions are met.
Device, live-server, and signed-release behavior stay unverified as recorded in
`logs/BUGS.txt`.

covered by the existing suites. The feature-action review trace confirms that a composer
presentation change needs no shell contract change and no fixture change.

No device test ran. Live-server and signed-release behavior stay unverified.

C-12b verification result: `ShellBackPolicyTest` (8 cases), `NavigationTest`, and
`WideNavigationTest` passed. `test assembleRelease` passed. `:app:lintDebug` passed when run
alone. No behavior changed. The unit cases cover the full precedence order, the wide-layout
overlay order, media-viewer back ownership, and the idle-Home null target. The navigation
suites characterize back dismissal through the shell.

No device test ran. Live-server and signed-release behavior stay unverified.

C-12c verification result: `ReplyComposerTest` on the new feature harness, plus
`NavigationTest`, `ComposerOwnerTest`, and `ShellBackPolicyTest`, passed.
`test assembleRelease` passed. `:app:lintDebug` passed when run alone. The migrated test
keeps its assertions. No production behavior changed.

No device test ran. Live-server and signed-release behavior stay unverified.

## Unresolved Blockers

- No emulator or device is reachable in the agent shell. Connected instrumentation stays unverified.
- Live-server behavior stays unverified.
- Signed-release behavior stays unverified.
- The Android 15 system-bar instrumentation failure remains in `logs/BUGS.txt`.
- `ru-RU` and `in-ID` localization is unblocked by slice L-01. Russian and Indonesian are
  selectable with confident navigation subsets. Full catalog translation stays open.
