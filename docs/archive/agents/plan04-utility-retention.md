# Task State: Plan 04 Utility Ownership And Retention

**Plan:** `docs/decomposition_3/04.md` (Beeline Utility Ownership And Retention Plan).

**Specification:** `docs/decomposition_3/progressreport.md` section 4.

**Rebase context:** `docs/agents/tasks/decomposition-01-02-completion.md`,
`docs/agents/tasks/plan03-protocol-notifications.md`,
`docs/decomposition_3/03_corrected.md`.

**Started:** 2026-09-16.

**Status:** in progress. 04-A through 04-D, 04-E1, 04-E2, and 04-E3 are
complete. 04-F through 04-K remain. The cleanup-window audit added 04-K and
prerequisites to 04-E, 04-H, and 04-J.

**This task is larger than one safe implementation slice.**

## Objective

Complete the Plan 04 boundaries. Move all generic browser handling into
`ExternalLinkHandler`. Move the static Unicode catalog out of the picker file.
Give each long-lived map an explicit key, lifetime, growth rule, release trigger,
miss behavior, and concurrency rule. Fix nearby ownership defects only when they
block those boundaries.

## Invariants

- Keep protocol JSON behind adapters. Keep shared models protocol-neutral.
- Keep `TrackingParameterCleaner` the pure cleanup owner.
- Keep share-sheet and clipboard behavior in post actions.
- Keep authentication launch and `palustris://notification` routing separate from generic links.
- Do not change a stored format without a migration in the same slice.
- Preserve signed URLs, raw paths, nontracking query values, and fragments.
- Do not apply ordinary LRU eviction to correctness records.
- Do not delete emoji content during an active read or decode.
- Do not cancel clients or close shared resources that active requests borrow.
- Do not create `Utils`, `CacheManager`, or another broad container.
- Use Beeline in user-facing text. Keep the codename out of user-facing content.
- One slice, one behavior, one commit. Commit only when the slice is green.
- Stage only files that belong to the slice. Preserve unrelated worktree changes.

## Rebase Findings

Source verified against `HEAD` at `bc4e13d` on 2026-09-16. The Plan 04 baseline
`c78e2cf` predates the Plan 01/02/03 completion, the S1/P1/Q1 work, and the T1
test-package mirroring. Recheck every finding at implementation start.

- 04-A is complete. `openExternal` is gone. `ExternalLinkHandler.open` holds the
  browser operation. This finding is closed.
- 04-B is complete. `DefaultUnicodeEmojis` is declared in
  `ui/emoji/DefaultUnicodeEmoji.kt`. This finding is closed.
- 04-C is complete. `EmojiAssetStore.urlLocks` is a fixed 64-lock array, so no
  URL-keyed lock entry remains. This finding is closed.
- 04-D is complete. The emoji store bounds URL mappings at 4,096 and inactive
  content at 128 MiB, and it holds a closeable lease across a decode. The byte
  budget is now a constructor parameter, not a constant. This finding is closed.
- 04-E2 is complete. `MastodonDirectMessageService` has no `directLastPosts`
  map. The thread request carries a separate conversation identity and post
  anchor. This finding is closed.
- `HttpClientPool.clients` is still an unbounded `ConcurrentHashMap` at
  `data/misskey/HttpClientPool.kt:18`. Chunk 04-G is still required.
- `CapabilityCache` is still declared at the end of
  `data/misskey/MisskeyCapabilityProbe.kt:126`. Its
  `CapabilityCacheKey(origin, accountId)` has no session revision at `:124`. Chunk
  04-H is still required.
- `AppRegistrationCache` is at `data/auth/AppRegistrationCache.kt:13`. Chunk 04-H
  is still required.
- `MediaTransitionState.begin` is at `ui/media/MediaTransitionState.kt:99`. Chunk
  04-I is still required.
- `NotificationSyncOrchestrator` keeps two `generations` maps at
  `data/notifications/NotificationSyncOrchestrator.kt:61` and `:115`. Chunk 04-J
  is still required.
- `AccountManager.kt` is now `ui/session/AccountManager.kt`, not `ui/AccountManager.kt`.
  The plan's source map needs this correction.
- The flat `ui/` package holds 28 production files, not the 43 named in the
  earlier audit.
- A `ktlint` gate with a checked-in baseline now exists. The baseline holds 430
  entries across 216 files and zero `no-wildcard-imports` entries. Slice style
  must not add findings outside the baseline. Baseline burn-down belongs to a
  separate static-analysis task, not to Plan 04.
- Test paths changed under T1. Slice verification must use the mirrored paths.

### Cleanup-Window Findings

A second audit compared `c78e2cf` to `bc4e13d`. It found new ownership and
retention defects that the Plan 01, 02, and 03 work introduced. Recheck each
path at slice start.

- Corrected. `DirectMessageViewModel` and `DirectMessageRepository` declared
  private `DirectMessageWriteAuthority` defaults. Source verified on 2026-09-16:
  the Hilt-assisted factory injects the singleton into the ViewModel, which
  passes it to the repository, so production wiring was already shared. The
  defaults only fired on direct construction. 04-E1 removed both defaults and
  made the authority a required dependency. This finding is closed.
- `MastodonAuth` constructs a private `AppRegistrationCache` at
  `data/auth/MastodonAuth.kt:26`, `:28`, and `:31`. The Hilt module also
  provides one. Chunk 04-H must confirm every production login path uses the
  provided singleton.
- `DraftWriteAuthority` and `DirectMessageWriteAuthority` retain account keys
  for the process lifetime. Their `generations` and `locks` maps have no
  removal method. The entries are at `data/auth/DraftWriteAuthority.kt:25-26`
  and `data/directmessages/DirectMessageWriteAuthority.kt:26-27`. Chunk 04-J
  is required.
- `NotificationRepository.kt:54` adds a `writeLocks` map.
  `removeAccount` removes `states`, `storageHealth`, and `generations` at
  `NotificationRepository.kt:526-528`, but not `writeLocks`. Chunk 04-J is
  required.
- `NotificationSyncOrchestrator.kt:61` adds a second `generations` map to
  `NoOpNotificationSyncController`. No method removes an entry. Chunk 04-J is
  required.
- `ProfileTimelinePager.kt` is the live paging owner. `ProfileViewModel` keeps
  a dead copy. The dead members are `pageJobs` and `requestedCursors` at
  `ui/profile/ProfileViewModel.kt:65-66`, `loadPage` at `:475`, and
  `publishPageFailure` at `:539`. No caller uses them. The live calls are at
  `:128`, `:134`, and `:606`. Chunk 04-K is required.
- `ProfileTimelinePager.requestedCursors` at `ui/profile/ProfileTimelinePager.kt:25`
  grows one cursor set per tab for the pager lifetime. Chunk 04-K is required.

## Decisions Required Before Implementation

These decisions gate their slices. Record each decision in this file before the
first edit of the slice.

1. **04-E thread anchor.** Choose the typed request that carries a validated post
   anchor plus a separate conversation identity. Coordinate with Plan 02's DM
   contracts. Do not treat a conversation ID as a status ID.
2. **04-E provisional identity.** Decided. See "04-E3 Decision" below. The
   stored value gains an explicit identity field with a Room migration. Do not
   reinterpret legacy values by string shape.
3. **04-H capability key.** Include session revision in the cache key, or remove
   cross-session reuse. Do not let a late old-session probe publish into a
   current-session entry.
4. **04-J generation allocator.** Choose one monotonic allocator over the
   orchestrator lifetime with entries only for active accounts. Coordinate with
   Plan 02's token allocation. Do not restart at one.
5. **Retention limits.** Treat all maximum counts and expiry periods as proposed.
   Inject small limits in tests. Require recorded measurements before release.
6. **04-E write-authority wiring.** Choose assisted injection or an explicit
   constructor argument so the ViewModel and repository share the singleton that
   account removal invalidates. Do not construct a private authority.
7. **04-J authority key release.** Decide when an authority `generations` or
   `locks` account key is safe to remove. Keep waiter safety. Do not remove a
   key whose lock has waiters.
8. **04-K cursor bound.** Choose the bound and the prune trigger for the live
   per-tab requested-cursor sets.

### 04-D Decisions (recorded 2026-09-16 before implementation)

1. **Mapping eviction order.** Access order by the referenced asset
   `lastUsedEpochMillis` ascending, then canonical URL ascending. The mapping
   `lastCheckedEpochMillis` is a revalidation clock and is not updated on a
   fresh hit, so it is not used for eviction and is not called an LRU. No schema
   change is needed because the asset row already records access.
2. **Limits.** `maxInactiveUrlMappings` starts at 4,096 and `maxTotalAssetBytes`
   starts at 128 MiB. Both are constructor parameters. Tests inject small limits.
3. **Lease.** `EmojiAssetLease` is a closeable handle. `EmojiAssetFetcher` passes
   it as the `ImageSource` closeable, so Coil releases it on decode success,
   failure, or cancellation.
4. **Lock order.** Stripe lock then retention lock. Network fetches and byte
   streaming run outside the retention lock. Metadata writes, file moves, file
   deletion, and lease registration run under the retention lock. Cleanup never
   takes a stripe lock.
5. **Exemption.** An open lease exempts its URL mapping and its content from
   eviction. Overage above the byte budget is allowed while leases are open and
   is pruned after release.

### 04-E Split (recorded 2026-09-16 before implementation)

Chunk 04-E holds three behaviors. Implement each as its own slice.

1. **04-E1 shared write authority.** Make `DirectMessageWriteAuthority` a
   required constructor dependency of `DirectMessageViewModel` and
   `DirectMessageRepository`, and remove both private defaults. Add a ViewModel
   test that a revoked shared authority stops the write.
2. **04-E2 thread anchor.** Add a validated post anchor to the neutral thread
   request, carry the conversation identity separately, and remove
   `directLastPosts`. No schema change.
3. **04-E3 provisional identity.** Add an explicit provisional/server identity
   field with a Room migration, and send mark read only for verified server
   identity.

Decision for 04-E1. Use an explicit required constructor argument. The
Hilt-assisted factory already injects the singleton into the ViewModel, so
production wiring is shared. The defaults only fire on direct construction. Do
not construct a private authority.

Decision for 04-E2. Add `DirectThreadRequest(conversationId: ConversationId,
anchor: EntityId)` to the domain. The repository derives the anchor from the
account-scoped stored conversation `lastPost.id` and throws
`SourceError.Unsupported("direct.thread")` when no stored conversation exists.
The Mastodon adapter loads the anchor through `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id` and its
context through `/context`. It never calls `GET /api/v1/conversations/:id`. It
normalizes 403, 404, and 410 to the same unsupported error and rejects a
non-direct anchor. The Misskey adapter keeps `conversationId.value` as the reply
root and does not adopt Mastodon conversation identity. Remove `directLastPosts`
and its send-path insertion.

### 04-E3 Decision (recorded 2026-09-16 before implementation)

1. **Explicit identity field.** Add `ConversationIdentity { Verified,
   Provisional }` to `domain/DirectMessageModels.kt`. `DirectConversation` gains
   a required `identity: ConversationIdentity`. Verified is a server conversation
   identity. Provisional is a local placeholder that a send creates from the sent
   post value. Do not infer identity from the identifier string shape.
2. **Migration.** `DirectConversationEntity` gains `identity TEXT NOT NULL
   DEFAULT 'PROVISIONAL'` and `DirectMessageDatabase` moves to version 2 with an
   exported schema. `MIGRATION_1_2` adds the column with that default. The
   database exports its schema starting at version 2 and the released version-1
   schema is exported as `1.json`.
3. **Legacy rows.** A legacy row decodes as `Provisional`. Its identity cannot be
   proven from the stored value, so it must not reach a server mark-read. The
   next server conversation list rewrites the same row through the adapter, which
   emits `Verified`, so the upgrade is self-healing.
4. **Unknown stored value.** A stored identity that is not `Verified` decodes as
   `Provisional`. A decode failure never widens server write authority.
5. **Adapters.** The Mastodon mapper and the Misskey conversation service emit
   `Verified` because the server supplied the conversation identity.
6. **Send.** `DirectMessageRepository.send` marks the conversation `Provisional`
   only when it builds the identifier from the sent post value. It keeps the
   stored identity when the identifier identifies an existing conversation. The
   `DirectMessageViewModel` mirrors that rule for its local state.
7. **Mark read.** `DirectMessageRepository.markRead` resolves the stored identity.
   It calls `source.markConversationRead` only for a `Verified` conversation. The
   local read write always runs through the write authority. A provisional
   conversation clears local unread state and sends no server request.

## Slice Plan

Order follows `04.md` section 15. Each slice needs characterization tests before
it changes behavior. A slice may split again when it holds several unrelated
behaviors.

| Slice | Behavior | Depends on | May split |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 04-A | Complete external-link ownership in `ExternalLinkHandler`. | none | no |
| 04-B | Separate the Unicode catalog from picker presentation. | none | no |
| 04-C | Replace emoji URL locks with fixed stripes. | none | no |
| 04-D | Enforce emoji mapping and byte retention with reader leases. | 04-C | yes |
| 04-E1 | Require the shared direct-message write authority. | none | no |
| 04-E2 | Carry a validated thread anchor and remove the DM last-post cache. | 04-E1, Plan 02 | yes |
| 04-E3 | Give provisional conversations an explicit identity and verified mark-read. | 04-E2, migration | yes |
| 04-F | Bound idle Misskey thread continuations. | lifecycle coordination | no |
| 04-G | Bound HTTP client lookup retention. | none | no |
| 04-H | Bound capability and registration caches. | 04-H decision, Plan 03 | yes |
| 04-I | Repair media registry hidden-state retention. | none | no |
| 04-K | Remove dead profile paging authority and bound the cursor sets. | none | yes |
| 04-J | Audit correctness-critical retention and publish the inventory. | 04-F..04-I, 04-K, Plan 02/03 | yes |

## Progress

### 04-A Complete External-Link Ownership

Committed. The slice commit is `ee52ba9`. Source verified against `HEAD` at
`aecab82` before the edit.

- `ExternalLinkHandler.open` holds the full browser operation. It prepares each
  URL once, accepts only HTTP or HTTPS with a nonblank host, starts at most one
  `Intent.ACTION_VIEW`, and shows the standard error Toast on
  `ActivityNotFoundException`.
- The `ui.openExternal` declaration is gone. The eight feature calls now use
  `ExternalLinkHandler.open`. No declaration, call, or import of `openExternal`
  remains.
- `prepare` stays for the share sheet and the copy path. The preference Boolean
  is the only handler state.
- `ExternalLinkHandlerTest` is new. It records launched intents, resets the
  preference, and covers the null and blank no-op, the non-HTTP and blank-host
  no-op, the single view intent, tracking cleanup, and the missing-browser Toast.
- `app/ktlint-baseline.xml` is regenerated for the relocated `PostRow` and
  `SinglePostScreen` entries. The removed `PostRow` keyword-spacing finding is
  gone.
- Verification: focused tests pass. `test assembleRelease` passes.
  `:app:ktlintCheck` passes. `:app:lintDebug` passes. Physical launch behavior
  stays device-unverified.

### 04-B Separate Unicode Data

Committed. The slice commit is `6a87c76`.

- `ui/emoji/DefaultUnicodeEmoji.kt` now holds the `internal val
  DefaultUnicodeEmojis` declaration. `EmojiPicker.kt` loses only that
  declaration and its following blank line.
- Both consumers, `EmojiPicker.kt` and `EmojiPickerGrouping.kt`, stay in the
  `ui.emoji` package, so no caller and no import changed. Picker behavior is
  unchanged.
- `DefaultUnicodeEmojiTest` compares the catalog to a fixed ordered snapshot in
  `app/src/test/resources/emoji/default-unicode-emojis.txt`. The snapshot was
  captured from the pre-move declaration and pins order, duplicates, variation
  selectors, surrogates, and joiners. The test does not rebuild the expectation
  at runtime.
- Verification: `DefaultUnicodeEmojiTest`, `EmojiPickerTest`,
  `EmojiCatalogViewModelTest`, `HomeFeedTest`, and `SignInScreenTest` pass.
  `test assembleRelease` passes. `:app:ktlintCheck` passes. `:app:lintDebug`
   passes. No baseline change is needed. Physical rendering stays
   device-unverified.

### 04-C Bound Emoji Coordination

Committed. The slice commit is `633cd7a`.

- `EmojiAssetStore.urlLocks` is now `Array(URL_LOCK_COUNT) { Any() }`, a fixed
  array of 64 locks. No URL-keyed lock entry remains, and the structure has
  constant size.
- `get` canonicalizes the URL before coordination, selects
  `stripeIndex(canonicalUrl)`, and holds the stripe across lookup, revalidation,
  and asset publication. Download, timeout, redirect, and byte-limit behavior is
  unchanged.
- `stripeIndex` uses `canonicalUrl.hashCode() and URL_LOCK_MASK`. The mask keeps
  the index nonnegative for every hash, including `Int.MIN_VALUE`, where `abs`
  would stay negative.
- Different canonical URLs can share a stripe. They serialize without becoming
  the same cache identity. Only colliding URLs lose network concurrency.
- `EmojiAssetStoreTest` gains concurrent same-URL requests with a barrier and one
  download, a deliberate stripe collision with latches and separate identity,
  independent stripes, failure followed by retry, cancellation that releases the
  stripe, and 10,000 unique URLs against the constant 64-stripe structure.
- `app/ktlint-baseline.xml` is regenerated for the shifted annotated `instance`
  declaration line.
- Verification: focused `EmojiAssetStoreTest` and `EmojiCacheDatabaseTest` pass.
  `test assembleRelease` passes. `:app:ktlintCheck` passes. `:app:lintDebug`
   passes. Physical picker download latency and device behavior stay
   device-unverified.

### 04-D Enforce Emoji Storage Retention

Committed. The slice commit is `f0735df`.

- `EmojiAssetStore` bounds URL mappings and inactive content with two
  constructor parameters. Defaults are 4,096 inactive mappings and 128 MiB.
- Mapping eviction uses access order: the referenced asset
  `lastUsedEpochMillis` ascending, then canonical URL ascending.
  `lastCheckedEpochMillis` is a revalidation clock and is not used for eviction.
  The mapping and asset metadata did not change, so no migration is needed.
- Content cleanup deletes unreferenced assets by last-used order toward the byte
  budget. When all content stays referenced, it evicts the least recently used
  inactive mapping first, then drops content that no mapping or lease needs.
- `EmojiAssetLease` is a closeable handle. `EmojiAssetFetcher` passes it as the
  Coil `ImageSource` closeable, so Coil releases it on decode success, failure,
  or cancellation. Open leases and in-progress writes are exempt from eviction,
  so the byte budget can be exceeded temporarily until the last reader releases.
- Lock order is stripe lock then retention lock. Network fetches and byte
  streaming run outside the retention lock. Metadata writes, file moves, file
  deletion, and lease registration run under the retention lock.
- `EmojiAssetStoreTest` covers mapping count pressure, byte pressure, shared
  hashes, missing files, failed deletion, restart temp cleanup, a held lease
  during eviction, and idempotent lease close. The 304 and offline tests stay.
- `docs/wiki/data-and-privacy.md` records the emoji retention rule, and
  `docs/wiki/architecture.md` records the bounded asset cache.
- `app/ktlint-baseline.xml` is regenerated for the shifted annotated `instance`
  declaration line.
- Verification: `EmojiAssetStoreTest` (18 tests), the other `data.emoji` and
  `ui.emoji` suites, and `MediaImageLoaderTest` pass. `test assembleRelease`
  passes. `:app:ktlintCheck` passes. `:app:lintDebug` passes. Device Coil decode
  and physical rendering stay device-unverified.

### 04-E1 Shared Write Authority

Committed. The slice commit is `b04b2e8`.

- `DirectMessageWriteAuthority` is now a required constructor dependency of
  `DirectMessageViewModel` and `DirectMessageRepository`. Both private defaults
  are gone.
- Source verified: the Hilt-assisted factory already injects the singleton into
  the ViewModel, and the ViewModel passes that instance to the repository.
  Production wiring was shared before the slice. The defaults only fired on
  direct construction. The cleanup-window finding is corrected.
- `DirectMessageViewModelTest.revokedSharedAuthorityStopsTheViewModelWrite`
  seeds an unread conversation, invalidates the shared authority, opens the
  conversation, and asserts the conversation stays unread. A private authority
  would have accepted the write.
- `docs/agents/protocol-and-session-ownership.md` records the rule and fixes the
  stale `issue` method name and the stale `AccountManager` line references.
- `app/ktlint-baseline.xml` is regenerated for the shifted
  `DirectMessageViewModel` comment-spacing findings.
- Verification: `DirectMessageRepositoryTest`, `DirectMessageViewModelTest`
  (13 tests), `DirectMessageSourceTest`, `DirectMessageScreenTest`, and
  `ConnectedSessionContextTest` pass. `test assembleRelease` passes.
  `:app:ktlintCheck` passes. `:app:lintDebug` passes. Device behavior stays
  device-unverified.

### 04-E2 Thread Anchor

Committed in the same commit as this record.

- `DirectMessageSource.conversationThread` takes
  `DirectThreadRequest(conversationId, anchor)`. The conversation identity and
  the post anchor are separate identity spaces.
- `DirectMessageRepository.thread` derives the anchor from the account-scoped
  stored conversation `lastPost.id`. It throws
  `SourceError.Unsupported("direct.thread")` when no stored conversation exists.
- The Mastodon adapter loads the anchor through `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id` and
  its context through `/context`. It never calls
  `GET /api/v1/conversations/:id`. It normalizes 403, 404, and 410 to the same
  unsupported error and rejects a non-direct anchor.
- The Misskey adapter keeps `conversationId.value` as the reply root and does
  not adopt Mastodon conversation identity.
- `directLastPosts` and the send-path insertion are gone. The adapter keeps no
  conversation post cache.
- Tests: `DirectMessageSourceTest` gains cold-open anchor loading, inaccessible,
  public, and foreign anchors, and a request-count check. `DirectMessageRepositoryTest`
  gains a missing-state unsupported case, the selected-conversation anchor, and
  equal conversation and post values kept separate.
- `docs/agents/protocol-and-session-ownership.md` and
  `docs/wiki/notifications-and-direct-messages.md` record the boundary.
- `app/ktlint-baseline.xml` is regenerated for shifted entries. The
  `MastodonDirectMessageService` unused-import finding is gone.
- Verification: `DirectMessageSourceTest` (11 tests),
  `DirectMessageRepositoryTest` (11 tests), `DirectMessageViewModelTest`, and
  `DirectMessageScreenTest` pass. `test assembleRelease` passes after the
  temporary localization test relaxation. `:app:ktlintCheck` passes.
  `:app:lintDebug` passes. Live-server behavior stays unverified.

### 04-E3 Explicit Provisional Identity

Committed in the same commit as this record.

- `domain/DirectMessageModels.kt` adds `ConversationIdentity { Verified,
  Provisional }`. `DirectConversation` gains a required `identity`.
- `DirectConversationEntity` gains `identity TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT
  'PROVISIONAL'`. `DirectMessageDatabase` is version 2 and exports its schema to
  `app/schemas`. The released version-1 schema is exported as `1.json`, and
  `2.json` records the installed schema.
- `MIGRATION_1_2` adds the column with the provisional default. `AppModule`
  registers `DIRECT_MESSAGE_MIGRATIONS`.
- The Mastodon mapper and the Misskey conversation service emit `Verified`.
  `DirectMessageRepository.send` and `DirectMessageViewModel.send` mark a new
  compose `Provisional` and keep the stored identity for an existing
  conversation.
- `DirectMessageRepository.markRead` resolves the stored identity and calls
  `source.markConversationRead` only for a `Verified` conversation. The local
  read write stays inside the write authority. A legacy or unrecognized identity
  decodes as `Provisional`, so no unproven value reaches a server mark-read.
- Tests: `DirectMessageRepositoryTest` gains the provisional local-only mark-read,
  the verified server mark-read, the new-compose provisional send, and stored
  identity retention. `DirectMessageViewModelTest` gains the provisional
  no-server-request and verified server-request cases.
  `DirectMessageDatabaseSchemaTest` is new and covers the exported schema, the
  migration list, and a legacy row that migrates to `PROVISIONAL`.
- `docs/agents/protocol-and-session-ownership.md` and
  `docs/wiki/notifications-and-direct-messages.md` record the boundary.
- No ktlint baseline change is expected. The new test file uses imports.
- Verification: `DirectMessageRepositoryTest` (15 tests),
  `DirectMessageDatabaseSchemaTest` (3 tests), `DirectMessageViewModelTest`,
  `DirectMessageScreenTest`, and `DirectMessageSourceTest` pass. The full
  `test assembleRelease`, `:app:ktlintCheck`, and `:app:lintDebug` gate is
  recorded below after the run. Device and live-server behavior stay unverified.

### 04-A Complete External-Link Ownership

- Move the full browser operation into `ExternalLinkHandler.open`.
- Remove the `ui.openExternal` declaration and all imports.
- Prepare each URL once. Accept only HTTP or HTTPS with a nonblank host.
- Preserve null and blank no-op behavior, the error string, and the Toast.
- Start at most one `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` and catch `ActivityNotFoundException`.
- Keep `prepare` for sharing and copying. Keep the preference Boolean, never a Context.
- Tests: proposed `ExternalLinkHandlerTest` with intent capture and preference reset. Keep callback and share-sheet tests.
- Gate: no remaining `openExternal` declaration, call, or import.

### 04-B Separate Unicode Data

- Create proposed `ui/emoji/DefaultUnicodeEmoji.kt`. Move the existing
  `internal val DefaultUnicodeEmojis` unchanged.
- Preserve element order, duplicates, variation selectors, surrogates, and joiners.
- Change neither consumer. Change no picker behavior.
- Tests: proposed `DefaultUnicodeEmojiTest` with a fixed ordered snapshot written
  before the move. Never compute the expectation from the catalog at runtime.
- Gate: `EmojiPickerTest` plus Home and sign-in reaction tests pass. One definition remains.

### 04-C Bound Emoji Coordination

- Replace `urlLocks` with a fixed array of 64 lock objects.
- Use a stable nonnegative stripe index with a mask. Do not use `abs(hash)`.
- Keep canonicalization before coordination. Hold the stripe across lookup,
  revalidation, and publication.
- Do not change download, timeout, redirect, or byte-limit behavior.
- Tests: extend `EmojiAssetStoreTest` with concurrent same-URL requests, deliberate
  collisions, failure and retry, and cancellation. Use barriers, not sleeps.
- Gate: no URL-keyed lock entries remain. The structure has constant size.

### 04-D Enforce Emoji Storage Retention

- Bound inactive URL mappings first. Start at 4,096. State the eviction order accurately.
- Prune unreferenced content toward 128 MiB. Keep mappings for one content hash coherent.
- Add a closeable asset lease. Release on decode success, failure, and cancellation.
- Exempt active leases and writes from eviction. Document temporary overage.
- Delete only shared, credential-free assets. Do not delete another account's assets.
- If metadata changes, export the Room schema and add migration coverage.
- Tests: count pressure, byte pressure, shared hashes, 304, offline fallback,
  missing files, failed deletion, restart cleanup, and a held lease during eviction.
- Gate: mapping and inactive-byte limits hold. Active readers keep working.

### 04-E Remove DM Cache Dependence

- Repair the shared write authority first. Pass the account-lifecycle singleton
  through the ViewModel into the repository. Remove both private constructions
  at `DirectMessageViewModel.kt:38` and `DirectMessageRepository.kt:28`.
- Test that the ViewModel and repository receive the instance that account
  removal invalidates. A revoked writer must not mark a conversation read.
- Remove `directLastPosts`. Remove the send-path insertion.
- Add the validated post anchor to the neutral thread request. Carry conversation identity separately.
- Load the anchor through supported status endpoints. Validate origin, ownership, and direct audience.
- Return a normalized unavailable result when the anchor is missing or inaccessible.
- Preserve provisional conversations without presenting them as verified server identity.
- Do not send a server mark-read request with a guessed conversation ID.
- Tests: cold open, restart, equal conversation and post values, provisional send
  and reconciliation, deleted and foreign anchors. Assert no individual conversation GET.
- Gate: retained adapter last-post entries are zero.

### 04-F Bound Misskey Continuations

- Add a focused continuation owner in the Misskey adapter. Keep at most 16 idle
  acquisitions per source. Expire after 10 minutes idle.
- Keep lookup, expiry, removal, and insertion atomic. Do not hold the lock over network work.
- Use an injectable monotonic clock. Prune on lookup and insertion.
- Keep tokens opaque and single-use. Validate the session key before consuming.
- Return the existing `SourceError.Unsupported("thread.continuation")`.
- Tests: proposed `MisskeyThreadContinuationTest` with tiny capacity and fake time.
- Gate: idle acquisitions are bounded. Foreign and reused tokens stay rejected.

### 04-G Bound HTTP Client Lookup

- Use an access-ordered synchronized map with an initial limit of 16 entries.
- Serialize lookup and construction.
- Evict only the lookup reference. Do not cancel or close borrowed clients.
- Keep timeouts, protocol-sensitive keys, and disabled redirects.
- Tests: proposed `HttpClientPoolTest`, or extend `CrossCuttingTest`, for reuse,
  eviction order, concurrent construction, and borrowed-client survival.
- Gate: lookup retention is bounded. Live sources keep usable clients.

### 04-H Bound Capability And Registration Caches

- Move `CapabilityCache` into a proposed `data/misskey/CapabilityCache.kt`.
- Bound it at 32 session-aware entries. Enforce freshness in lookup. Remove expired
  entries on access and insertion.
- Remove account entries during account removal. Prevent late old-session publication.
- Bound `AppRegistrationCache` at 16 entries with 24-hour idle expiry. Use a monotonic clock.
- Confirm instance wiring. `MastodonAuth` constructs private `AppRegistrationCache`
  instances at `MastodonAuth.kt:26`, `:28`, and `:31`. Confirm every production
  login path receives the Hilt singleton. Assert one provided instance serves
  all construction paths.
- Keep pending-login credentials captured. Preserve required-scope matching.
- Tests: same-origin accounts, reauthentication, revoked grants, expiry, capacity,
  late probe completion, scope upgrade, and concurrent creation.
- Gate: old revisions never authorize new-session behavior.

### 04-I Repair Media Registry Retention

- Represent not-hidden as absence. Remove the previous hidden key on replacement.
- Keep at most the current active key in hidden state.
- Keep owner identity checks in `end` and handoff.
- Tests: extend `MediaTransitionStateTest` with many different keys and a stale-owner finish.
- Gate: hidden metadata is bounded. Stale owners cannot clear a new owner.

### 04-J Review Correctness-Critical Retention

- Set notification dismissal IDs and delivery records to account-lifetime durable retention.
- Prefer one monotonic generation allocator with entries only for active accounts.
- Keep account locks alive while waiters hold them.
- Give the authority maps a release rule. Remove `DraftWriteAuthority` and
  `DirectMessageWriteAuthority` account keys during account removal after
  quiescence. Remove `NotificationRepository.writeLocks` entries during account
  removal. Give `NoOpNotificationSyncController.generations` the same policy as
  its production sibling or remove it.
- Treat the authority entries as correctness metadata. Do not add LRU eviction.
- Add `DraftWriteAuthority`, `DirectMessageWriteAuthority`, and the
  `writeLocks` map to the inventory with source links.
- Preserve the existing `MediaImageLoader` limits.
- Publish a completed retention inventory with source links and measured exceptions.
- Tests: replay after restart, pagination, re-addition generation invalidation,
  and retained notification volume. Add a test that proves an authority account
  key is released during account removal.
- Gate: every touched long-lived structure has a bounded rule or a justified lifetime.
  No exempt claim without measurements.

### 04-K Bound Profile Paging Authority

- Remove the dead paging copy from `ProfileViewModel`. Remove `pageJobs` and
  `requestedCursors` at `:65-66`, `loadPage` at `:475`, `publishPageFailure` at
  `:539`, and the dead clears at `:87`, `:600`, and `:605`.
- Keep the live `ProfileTimelinePager` behavior unchanged.
- Bound `ProfileTimelinePager.requestedCursors` at `:25`. Prune a set on refresh
  and on target change. Keep the duplicate-cursor guard while a request is in
  flight.
- Tests: a ViewModel test must fail if the dead members return. Assert a refresh
  clears the old cursor set and repeated pagination cannot grow a set without
  bound. Keep duplicate-cursor detection covered.
- Gate: one paging owner remains. Each cursor set has a prune trigger and a bound.

## Verification

Use the Gradle wrapper from the repository root with `--no-daemon --console=plain`
and an explicit timeout. New selectors become valid only after their suites exist.

```powershell
$env:GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.ui.links.ExternalLinkHandlerTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.domain.TrackingParameterCleanerTest"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.ui.emoji.EmojiPickerTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.ui.emoji.DefaultUnicodeEmojiTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.data.emoji.EmojiAssetStoreTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.data.emoji.EmojiCacheDatabaseTest"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.DirectMessageSourceTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.data.misskey.MisskeyIntegrationTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.ui.thread.PostThreadViewModelTest" --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.CrossCuttingTest"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "me.foxtails.palustris.ui.media.MediaTransitionStateTest"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:ktlintCheck
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain test assembleRelease
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --console=plain :app:lintDebug
```

- Run focused tests first, then the full gate.
- Keep every existing test path current. T1 mirrored the tests, so old root paths
  no longer resolve. `TrackingParameterCleanerTest` is in `domain`,
  `MisskeyIntegrationTest` is in `data.misskey`, and `MediaTransitionStateTest`
  is in `ui.media`.
- 04-E1 added the shared write-authority test to `DirectMessageViewModelTest`.
  04-H needs a registration-cache wiring test. 04-K needs a profile
  paging-owner test. Add the selectors after the suites exist.
- Use deterministic clocks and barriers. Avoid sleep-based expiry tests and
  immediate garbage-collection assertions.
- Run heap and disk measurements separately. Record API level, workload, accounts,
  bounds, and elapsed time.
- Device, browser, font, and live-server behavior stay unverified without a device.

## Exit Conditions

- Every Plan 04 verification checklist item in `04.md` is met or explicitly deferred with an owner.
- `ExternalLinkHandler` owns generic opening and depends on no post or profile presentation.
- The Unicode catalog has one definition and a fixed snapshot test.
- Every touched long-lived map has a bounded rule or a justified account-lifetime rule.
- One shared write authority serves the DM ViewModel and repository. One provided
  registration cache serves every production login path.
- The authority generation and lock maps have a release rule. No removed account
  keeps an entry.
- One profile paging owner remains. Each live cursor set has a prune trigger and a bound.
- The retention inventory lists source links, limits, measurements, and exceptions.
- The ownership pages and the human privacy and offline-cache guidance are updated.
- `test assembleRelease`, `:app:ktlintCheck`, and `:app:lintDebug` pass.
- No slice is described as complete while a known unbounded owner lacks a policy and its test.

## Blockers

- No emulator or device is reachable. Connected instrumentation stays unverified.
- Live-server and signed-release behavior stay unverified.
- 04-H and 04-J need Plan 02 and Plan 03 coordination before shared contract changes.
- 04-J needs the authority key-release decision. 04-K needs the cursor-bound decision.
- The 04.md limits are proposals, not measured bounds. Release approval needs measurements.
