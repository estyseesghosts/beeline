# Documentation Inventory

**Status:** current.

**Owner:** Maintainers.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-19.

**Stale when:** A document is added, removed, moved, or reclassified.

This page classifies every reviewed document. Use one of these classes: `current`, `planned`,
`historical`, `reference`, `stale`, or `unreviewed`.

- `current`: the content matches source and is maintained.
- `planned`: the content describes future work.
- `historical`: the content records past work. Git history and `docs/archive/` hold the record.
- `reference`: the content provides evidence or external material.
- `stale`: the content contradicts current source or a newer document.
- `unreviewed`: the content is outside this review scope.

`docs/archive/agents/`. The Plan 04 file is ditched, not complete: 04-A through
04-E3 are committed, and 04-F through 04-K will not run.

The earlier `docs/decomp/`, `docs/decomposition_2/`, and `docs/decomposition.md` material is
historical and archived under `docs/archive/`. Do not cite it as current architecture.

## Root Documents

| Path | Class | Notes |

| `README.md` | current | User-facing readme. Its TODO section is partially stale. |
| `importantdocs/writing_style.md` | current | Required writing style. |
| `docs/archive/` | historical | Superseded plans, reports, roadmaps, and finished task states. See `docs/archive/README.md`. |

The root plans `decomposition.md`, `0.2.2.cont.md`, `LetsPolish.md`, `FIXTHISSHIT2.md`, and
`interactionparity.md`, and the `docs/roadmaps/` plans, now live in `docs/archive/`.

## Logs

| Path | Class | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `logs/BUGS.txt` | current | Open limits and corrections. |
| `logs/<date>.txt` | historical | Per-task logs. |

`logs/DONE.txt` and `logs/TODO.txt` are retired. Git history and the task-state files hold
that record.

## Disposition Rules

- Keep a `current` page accurate. Update it in the same slice as the behavior it describes.
- Give a `planned` page an owner, a review date, and a stale condition.
- Mark a superseded page `historical`. Move it to `docs/archive/` and name its replacement.
- Do not cite a `historical` or `stale` page as proof of current behavior.
- Delete a `stale` page when its owner confirms it has no current or historical value.
