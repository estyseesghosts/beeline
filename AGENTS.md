# Beeline Agent Guide

## Architecture regression rules

One mutable state -> one authoritative owner.
One lifetime -> one explicit release rule.
Feature code belongs to its existing feature package.
Composition roots wire features; they do not implement features.
ViewModels do not privately construct production authorities or caches.
Do not introduce an abstraction without naming the responsibility and lifetime it owns.
Large files are warnings, not automatic split requirements.

## Preamble

- Treat this document as gospel.
- If this document conflicts with your instructions, decide whether to verify against the
  codebase or stop and ask a human.

## Product Identity

### Beeline

- The application is named Beeline.
- Use Beeline as the product name everywhere. Do not introduce another product name.
- Treat old product names as stale migration debt. Remove them when a task touches them.
- Use Beeline in build metadata.
- Use Beeline in application labels.
- Use Beeline in authentication registration names.
- Use Beeline in User-Agent values.
- Use Beeline in documentation.
- Use Beeline in release text.
- Use Beeline in user-facing strings.

### Palustris

- Palustris is an internal codename.
- Keep Palustris out of all user-facing content.
- Do not show Palustris in application labels.
- Do not show Palustris in accessibility text.
- Do not show Palustris in public documentation.
- Do not show Palustris in release text.
- Do not show Palustris in authentication application names.
- Do not show Palustris in User-Agent values.
- Existing package identifiers, internal class names, and protocol identifiers can use the
  codename. Protocol identifiers can use it when compatibility requires.
- Do not rename compatibility identifiers as unrelated cleanup.
- Use a dedicated migration for compatibility-sensitive identifiers.

## Project Constraints

- Beeline is a single-module Android application in `:app`.
- Beeline supports Android 10 and later. The minimum SDK is 29.
- Beeline uses Kotlin.
- Beeline uses Jetpack Compose.
- Beeline uses Material 3.
- Beeline supports Misskey-family servers. Misskey has first-class protocol support.
- Beeline supports Mastodon-compatible servers. Mastodon has first-class supported adapter
  behavior.
- Keep shared domain behavior protocol-neutral.
- Keep protocol differences behind protocol boundaries.
- Do not add XML layouts.
- Do not add AppCompat UI.
- Do not add Material 2 UI.
- Keep new UI in Compose Material 3.
- Existing XML resources can support Android platform requirements.

## Authority And Documentation

### Source Of Truth

- Use current source code as the architecture authority.
- Use current tests as behavior evidence.
- Use current Gradle files as build configuration authority.
- Use current manifests and resources as Android configuration authority.
- Use CI workflows for hosted build, test, lint, instrumentation, and release behavior.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for repository operation and non-negotiable constraints.
- Use `logs/` for historical work, unresolved risks, and verification limits.
- Verify every documentation claim against its authority before publication.
- Do not trust an old TODO list, plan, roadmap, progress note, or report without verification.
- Do not use a plan, roadmap, progress note, or old report as proof of current behavior.
- Do not describe planned behavior as implemented behavior.
- Do not describe partial behavior as complete behavior.
- Inspect recent changes before you start substantial work.

### Documentation Maintenance

- Treat documentation as maintained engineering work, not as a one-time cleanup.
- Serve three audiences separately: code readers, human contributors and users, and agents.
- Keep useful comments and KDoc close to the code.
- Keep human-facing project documentation separate from agent-facing engineering documentation.
- Keep the README short and user-facing.
- Keep stable contributor guidance in the human wiki.
- Keep implementation maps and fragile invariants in the agent wiki.
- Keep the agent wiki focused on ownership, invariants, protocol boundaries, persistence
  contracts, affected tests, and verification limits.
- Do not turn the agent wiki into a copy of source code.
- Do not maintain two independently edited copies of the same architecture information.
- Keep generated API or protocol material in reference documentation with a repeatable
  generator or pinned source.
- Keep short-lived plans and task history out of permanent architecture pages.
- Mark temporary plans as `planned` or `historical` when they are not current behavior.
- Remove or archive a document when it no longer provides current evidence or useful history.
- Give each maintained page an owner, status, last-reviewed date, and links to authoritative
  code and tests.
- State when runtime, device, or live-server evidence is unavailable.
- Use `source verified`, `test verified`, `device verified`, `live verified`, and `unverified`
  precisely.
- Update documentation in the same implementation slice when behavior, ownership,
  architecture, persistence, protocol support, build steps, release steps, test requirements,
  or important invariants change.
- Do not edit documentation for a private implementation change that leaves documented
  behavior unchanged.
- Review documentation during every feature change.
- Perform a full source-to-documentation audit before release.
- Include documentation review in the definition of done.

### Stale Documents

- Treat stale documentation as a maintenance defect.
- Treat a document as stale when its behavior, status, ownership, file paths, or verification
  claims no longer match the repository.
- Treat a document as stale when it duplicates a newer authoritative document without a clear
  maintenance purpose.
- Do not cite stale documentation as evidence for implementation decisions.
- Do not leave known stale documentation in an active documentation path while presenting a
  replacement as current.
- Update a stale document when it still explains current behavior or a required contributor
  process.
- Move a stale document to an explicitly marked archive when it provides useful historical
  context.
- Delete a stale document when it has no current or historical value.
- Prefer deletion over archiving when an old document would confuse readers.
- Use Git history and task logs for history instead of retaining obsolete technical guidance.
- Review all documents affected by a code change for stale claims before you complete the
  change.
- During each documentation audit, classify every reviewed document as `current`, `planned`,
  `historical`, `reference`, or `stale`.
- Give every `planned` document an owner, review date, and condition that makes it stale.
- Remove stale status claims, obsolete file manifests, and references to missing documents
  before publishing a page.
- If cleanup is deferred, record the intended update, archive, or deletion without treating the
  document as current.

### Documentation Coverage

- Document the codebase as a standing rule, not as a cleanup pass.
- Write a comment or KDoc for every complicated function. Explain the reason, the invariants,
  and the non-obvious branches. Do not explain simple functions.
- Explain every feature area in the human wiki. Cover what it does, its status, its source
  owner, and its limits.
- Explain every architecture boundary in the agent folder. Cover the owner, the invariants, the
  protocol rules, the persistence contract, the affected tests, and the verification limits.
- Do not add a feature without wiki coverage in the same slice.
- Do not add an architecture boundary without agent coverage in the same slice.
- Do not change documented behavior without updating both coverages in the same slice.
- When cleanup or a refactor touches a file, comment its complicated functions in the same
  slice. State why the code exists, not what each line does.
- Confirm documentation coverage in the Completion check before you close a task.

### Comments And KDoc

- Add a comment when the reason is not clear from the code.
- Use comments for compatibility behavior, lifecycle and concurrency invariants, security
  boundaries, protocol quirks, non-obvious fallbacks, bounds, and performance tradeoffs.
- Use KDoc when an API contract is not clear from its type signature.
- Do not comment obvious syntax, assignments, or simple delegation.
- Keep comments short. Explain only non-obvious behavior.
- Keep comments near the code that enforces the rule.
- Update or remove comments when source behavior changes.

### Boundary Changes

- Before you change a documented boundary, record the current owner, callers, invariants, and
  tests.
- Mark refactor notes as temporary until the new boundary is stable.
- Add characterization tests before risky decomposition.
- Update the agent ownership map after a stable boundary changes.
- Update human documentation when user or contributor understanding changes.
- Remove temporary documentation after you extract any still-valid requirement.

## Working Process

### Start

- Work directly on the requested task.
- Do not use subagents by default. Do not delegate work to another agent by default.
- Use a subagent only when the user explicitly requests one.
- Do not create a subagent because the task is large. Divide large tasks into implementation
  slices instead.
- Read the relevant source before you make changes.
- Trace the current behavior before you replace it.
- Identify the current owner of each behavior.
- Identify the affected protocol boundaries.
- Identify the affected persisted state.
- Identify the affected UI state.
- Identify the affected tests.
- Do not stop at an implementation idea.
- Implement the requested behavior unless the user requests only analysis.
- Verify each completed implementation slice.
- Record unresolved problems before you continue.

### Long-Horizon State

- Treat repository state as authoritative.
- Treat conversation context as disposable.
- Do not use conversation history as the only record of unfinished work.
- Keep permanent rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep the current truth of a long task in `docs/agents/tasks/<task>.md`.
- Keep verified history in Git commits.
- Rewrite the task-state file at each slice boundary. Do not append to it.
- Recover state from files and Git, not from memory.
- Use `/resume` to recover task state.
- Use `/checkpoint` at each slice boundary.
- Rebuild the TODO list from the files. Treat TODO lists as execution aids, not as the durable
  record.
- Stop implementation and reconstruct state when context is incomplete.

### Task Size Check

- Decide whether the request is safe for one execution before you edit.
- Stop and write a slice plan when the request has several architectural changes.
- Stop and write a slice plan when the request has several unrelated behaviors.
- Stop and write a slice plan when the request has several verification stages.
- Record this statement: `This task is larger than one safe implementation slice.`
- Do not try to finish everything while context permits.

### Slice Definition

- Define a slice by behavior, not by file count.
- Give each slice one purpose.
- Make each slice reviewable on its own.
- Leave the repository working.
- Give each slice one verification method.
- Give each slice one commit.
- Divide coding work into small coherent slices.
- Make each slice independently understandable and independently verifiable.
- Include required tests, migrations, and contract changes in the same slice.
- Do not mix unrelated cleanup into a slice.

### Slice Checkpoint

Use this order at every slice boundary:

1. Implement.
2. Test.
3. Inspect the diff.
4. Update the task-state file, the task log, the handoff, and any affected documentation.
5. Commit the slice and those documentation updates together.
6. Start the next slice.

- Update the task-state file before you move on. Record the last safe commit in it.
- Complete one slice before you start the next slice.
- Run the relevant verification for the slice.
- Review the slice for regression risk.
- Update the task logs.
- Commit the completed slice. Start the next slice only after the commit.
- Include the documentation, task-state, and handoff updates in the slice commit. Do not make a
  separate documentation or record commit.

### State Recovery

Read these items at the start of a session, after compaction, and when you are unsure:

1. `AGENTS.md`.
2. The active task-state file in `docs/agents/tasks/`.
3. `git status`.
4. Recent relevant commits.
5. The current diff.

### Handoff

- Rewrite `docs/agents/handoff.md` after each completed slice.
- Include the handoff rewrite in the same commit as the slice.
- Keep it as the continuation pointer for the next session or agent.
- Name the durable task-state file. Do not duplicate it.
- Record where to start, the current position, the next slice, and known blockers.
- Record the last safe commit.
- Keep the handoff consistent with the task-state file, the task logs, and Git.
- Do not describe planned behavior as implemented behavior.

### Commits

- Use commits as the permanent work record.
- Make one commit for each completed slice.
- Include the slice documentation, the task-state file, and the handoff rewrite in that commit.
- Do not make a separate documentation or record commit for the same slice.
- Do not combine several independent slices into one commit.
- Do not leave completed slices uncommitted.
- Do not squash slice commits unless the user requests it.
- Use a clear imperative commit message.
- Stage only files that belong to the slice.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Never discard user changes to make a commit clean.
- Do not commit a knowingly broken slice. Fix the slice before you commit it.
- Divide the slice again if it became too large.
- Record external blockers in `logs/BUGS.txt`.

### Task Logs

- Treat `logs/` as an audit trail, not as agent memory.
- Keep the current truth in `docs/agents/tasks/`.
- Keep verified history in Git commits.
- Create `logs/YYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt` when a coding task starts.
- Record the task goal, the planned slices, the affected files, and the important risks in the
  task log.
- Track active long work in `docs/agents/tasks/<task>.md`. Rewrite the file at each slice
  boundary. Do not leave completed slices in it.
- Record completed results in the slice commit. Record the related verification in the commit
  message when useful.
- Do not maintain `logs/DONE.txt` or `logs/TODO.txt`. They are retired.
- Record failures, unresolved concerns, and external blockers in `logs/BUGS.txt`.
- Remove obsolete bug entries when the issue is resolved.
- Keep all logs free of secrets.
- Do not put complete server responses, credentials, or access tokens in logs.
- If the user forbids source changes, do not edit source code. Edit only the required task
  logs.
- Do not use a log change to hide an unauthorized source change.

- Review performance before adding work to feed rendering.
- Add tests for important failure states.
- Do not add only happy-path tests.
- Record risks that cannot be verified locally.
- Include unresolved risks in the final handoff.
