/**
 * Session-bound execution authority for post interaction families.
 *
 * Per-feature job maps cannot serialize the same target's reaction family across Home,
 * Profile, collections, and Thread. This gate is shared across surfaces: a second caller for
 * one family and effective target is rejected while the first owns the slot. The caller does
 * not wait. Slots are keyed by account and session revision, so replacement sessions never
 * block on stale owners. Feature owners keep their own rows, overlays, and membership.
 *
 * Each accepted acquisition returns the token that owns the slot. Only that token releases
 * the slot. A foreign or repeated release changes nothing.
