/**
 * One fan-out point for normalized post updates and accepted publications.
 *
 * The coordinator forwards an event to every registered sink except the origin. Nested forwarding
 * is suppressed, so a sink that re-emits while it applies an update cannot start a cycle. The
 * coordinator performs no network work, keeps no post copy, and makes no rollback decision.
 *
 * An update must match the bound account and durable revision. A foreign or stale update is
 * rejected before any sink sees it. A retired coordinator delivers nothing and accepts no new
 * sinks. The connected entry retires its coordinator, so a replaced lifetime cannot publish
 * through the old fan-out. Each accepted publication carries the identity of its created post.
 * A repeated delivery of the same publication is rejected, so every surface receives the
 * accepted action result once.
