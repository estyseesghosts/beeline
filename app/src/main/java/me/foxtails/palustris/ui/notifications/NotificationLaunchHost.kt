 * Owns the notification launch handoff.
 *
 * A launch is delivered only after its receiving account is the active account. The launch is
 * acknowledged only when the receiving shell accepts its route, so an undelivered launch is
 * never acknowledged. A missing receiving account routes to the recoverable unavailable
 * state. A failed account switch resolves through the accounts update, which reruns this
 * effect and routes the same unavailable state.
